    "In this tutorial, I will explain how the DOLPHINN package works internally and how you can use it to solve your own problems. Realise that currently DOLPHINN is quite tailored to spacecraft trajectories. The example problem considered here, will be the optimal control problem of sending a spacecraft to meet with Mars and match its velocity by using electric propulsion. This tutorial will mainly focuss on how the DOLPHINN module works, and how it can be used to solve your own custom problem. First, lets introduce the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a spacecraft with initial mass $m$ and an engine that can produce a maximum thrust force $u_{max}$ with a specific impulse $I_{sp}$. The acceleration model consists of only the central gravitional attraction from the sun. The state of the spacecraft will be described in terms of polar coordinates, $r, \\theta$ and the velocity vector will be described in terms of the transverse component $v_{\\theta}$ and the radial component $v_r$, as per the figure. The control vector of the thrust produced by the electric propulsion engine is described in the same basis as the velocity. However, the control is parameterized in terms of the magnitude $u_t = |\\mathbf{u}|$ and an angle $u_{\\phi}$. \n",

    "- At the intial time $t_0$, the spacecraft is at position $\\mathbf{z} (t_0) = \\mathbf{z}_0$\n",
    "- At the final time $t_f$, the spacecraft is at position $\\mathbf{z} (t_f) = \\mathbf{z}_f$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The objective will be the propellant mass $m_p$, which can be calculated by integrating the thrust force magnitude $u_{T}$.\n",

    "- The solution to this optimal control problem constitutes of a trajectory $\\mathbf{z}^* (t)$ and a control profile $\\mathbf{u}^* (t)$, that satisfies the dynamical constraints, the boundary conditions and burns the minimum amount of fuel. "
